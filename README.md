## What is Herb?

Herb is a fast, embeddable HTML+ERB parser and developer toolkit written in C, designed to support advanced tooling for `.html.erb` files.

It powers both low-level libraries (Ruby and JavaScript bindings) and high-level developer tools like linters, formatters, and language servers. These tools are all built on a shared foundation that enables precise analysis, transformation, and improvement of `.html.erb` code.

Additionally, you can find more info on the docs site [here](https://herb-tools.dev).
